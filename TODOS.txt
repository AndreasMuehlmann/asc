TODOS: 
- static ip address for raspi and multiple wlans
- document how to setup raspberry pi
- document cross-compilation
- document build process
- document deployment
- write README.md

- Send Data with WLAN => Client in C++
- Connecting BNO055 (either with library, probably has to be cross-compiled, or from scratch, or transpile to zig)

- maybe look at GSL - GNU Scientific Library - and see if it is necessary

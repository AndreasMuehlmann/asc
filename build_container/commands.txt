sudo systemctl (status|start|restart|stop) docker => for docker daemon

docker build . => builds the image
docker run -it <image-id> /bin/bash => for a shell
docker ps => shows running containers (-a for all containers)

docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) => deleting all containers

docker cp <path> <container-id>:<path>  => copying file (other way around also possible)
